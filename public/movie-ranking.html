    <h3>Following by Christofer Nolan</h3>
    Christofer Nolan made this movie when he was really young. It is his first movie actually. He does not have mony or time to
    make this masterpice. So he was filming every Sunday 7 minutes with one shot.

    <h3>Fleabag</h3>
    This is not a movie. This is tv series, that is about feminism but not tradicional way.
    It has a lot of metaphores. It is gfilmed actually so beautifully.

    <h3>Notting Hill</h3>
    Despite the fact that it is a romcom, it is filmed beautifully and watching that movie brings 
    a lot of calmness and joy inside me.
